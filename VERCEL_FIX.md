# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide ðŸ”§

## Problem Fixed
âœ… Removed the problematic secret reference from `vercel.json`

## Next Steps to Deploy Successfully

### 1. Commit and Push the Fix
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel configuration - remove secret reference"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Set Environment Variable in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
3. Add a new environment variable:
   - **Name**: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - **Value**: Your Render backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.onrender.com`)
   - **Environment**: Production (and Preview if needed)
4. Click **Save**

### 3. Redeploy
After pushing the fix and setting the environment variable:
1. Go to your Vercel project's **Deployments** tab
2. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment, OR
3. Vercel will automatically redeploy when it detects the new commit

## What Was Wrong?
The `vercel.json` file was trying to reference a Vercel secret `@react_app_api_url` that didn't exist. Environment variables should be set directly in the Vercel dashboard, not referenced as secrets in the config file unless you've explicitly created those secrets.

## Verification
After deployment:
1. Your frontend should be live at your Vercel URL
2. The React app will use the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable
3. No more "secret does not exist" errors

Your deployment should now work correctly! ðŸš€
